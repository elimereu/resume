title: ESPACE – the expression and spatial analysis pancreas atlas consortium europe.
summary: Three prior HCA early pilot studies of the pancreas have now come together to form the “Expression and Spatial analysis Pancreas Atlas Consortium Europe”, ESPACE. Based on methods and standards for sample procurement single cell profiling, spatial proteomics, and computational pipelines that were developed in these pilot studies, the ESPACE consortium will build a first version of the Human Cell Atlas of the Pancreas.
